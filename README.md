## Results

Base on the line chart urbn are has the highest "total rides, "total drivers" but the lowest "avg fare per ride" and "avg fare  per driver", rural area drivers get paid the most but the area haas the least number of drivers that are available.  Suburban area make signfcant $total fare compare to rural aream, however the number of drivers is way less than the total rides. 

## Summary:

There are more drivers avaible in the urban area compare to the rides, this leads to the result that drivers has less job and make less for each trip.However, there are signficatn shortage on drivers for suburban and rural area wich makes the price higher than usual, this might be the cuz of total rides is significantly less than urban area. Encourge drivers take rides in non-urban area can balances the fare thus attact more customers.
